# PSX.DEV Sample Code

Uses the vscode extension to setup a working C project with a pcsx-redux instance used with GDB server functionality.
Everything is built currently with make files which I want to simplify to not requiring if possible...  
My goal was to do the pikuma course mostly in assembly with some sys calls to help but now this is in the way..
